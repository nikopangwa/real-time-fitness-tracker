2️⃣ How It Was Customized for Our Project?
Added Columns
📌 Testing – Ensures Quality Assurance (QA) is part of the workflow.
📌 Blocked – Highlights tasks that need dependencies resolved.
📌 Review – Separates peer review from "In Progress" to streamline approvals.

Modified Labels
📌 Feature, Bug, Enhancement, Documentation, Critical – Helps categorize tasks effectively for Agile tracking.

Integration with Issues & Milestones
📌 Each sprint milestone is linked to a set of tasks on the Kanban board for better progress visibility.

📌 Why Not Other Templates?
🚫 Basic Kanban – Too manual, lacks automation for Agile sprint tracking.
🚫 Bug Triage – Great for issue tracking but doesn’t support full development workflows.
🚫 Team Planning – Suitable for roadmap planning but not ideal for short Agile sprints.

📌 Conclusion
📌 Automated Kanban was chosen because it provides the best balance of Agile sprint tracking, automation, and team collaboration. Customizing it with additional columns, labels, and integrations enhances its suitability for our project.

📌 This setup reduces manual work, increases sprint efficiency, and keeps development organized—ensuring smooth workflow execution.
