# Template Analysis

## Comparison of GitHub Project Templates

| Template Name       | Columns                 | Automation Features                          | Suitability for Agile |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**   | To Do, In Progress, Done | Manual task movement                        | Good for simple tracking |
| **Automated Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Done | Auto-moves issues based on status changes   | Ideal for Agile sprints |
| **Team Planning**   | Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Done | Supports cross-team collaboration | Best for large teams |

## Justification for Template Choice

For this project, I have selected **Automated Kanban** because:
1. **Built-in automation** reduces manual effort in moving issues.
2. **Supports sprint tracking**, aligning well with Agile methodologies.
3. **Enhances traceability** by linking issues from the backlog.
