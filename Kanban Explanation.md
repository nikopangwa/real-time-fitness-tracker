What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to track and manage tasks across different stages of a workflow. It organizes tasks by moving them through various columns, such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. The board gives team members a clear view of what work needs to be done, what's currently being worked on, and what's completed. This system is essential for continuous progress tracking and ensuring smooth team collaboration.

How Our Kanban Board Visualizes Workflow:
Columns Represent Task Progress:
Each column on our Kanban board represents a specific stage of the task's lifecycle. For example:

To Do: Tasks that are planned but not yet started.

In Progress: Tasks that are actively being worked on.

Testing: Tasks that have been completed and are being tested.

Done: Tasks that have been finished and are ready for delivery or deployment.

This structure makes it easy for team members to visualize the flow of work from one stage to the next, ensuring transparency and clear task management.

How Our Kanban Board Limits Work-in-Progress (WIP):
WIP Limits to Avoid Bottlenecks:
To maintain focus and avoid overloading any team member or stage of the process, we set WIP (Work-in-Progress) limits on each column.
For example, we may set a WIP limit of 3 tasks per column. This ensures that no more than three tasks are being worked on at the same time, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring that tasks are completed before new ones are started. By limiting WIP, we ensure that the team maintains focus and delivers high-quality results.

How Our Kanban Board Supports Agile Principles:
Continuous Delivery:
Our Kanban board allows for the continuous flow of tasks from one stage to the next. Tasks are completed and moved quickly through the columns, supporting continuous delivery. The board provides a clear view of the current workload, ensuring that tasks are regularly being completed and delivered without delay.

Adaptability:
Kanban is an inherently flexible system that can easily adapt to changes. If new tasks are added or priorities shift, the board can quickly reflect those changes, making it easy to adapt to new requirements. The visual nature of the Kanban board helps teams pivot their efforts based on new insights or feedback.

Example of How Our Kanban Board Works:
"A Kanban board is a visual tool that tracks tasks across stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress). Our board limits WIP to 3 tasks per column to ensure focused work. By restricting the number of tasks in progress at any given time, we ensure that team members are not overwhelmed and that each task gets the attention it deserves. This helps prevent delays and ensures a steady flow of work."
