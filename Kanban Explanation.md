What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that organizes work into columns to track task progress.

How Our Kanban Board Works

Columns Represent Workflow: Tasks move from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Testing" → "Done".

Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits: Ensures teams focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.

Supports Agile Principles: Encourages iterative development and flexibility.

Customizations

Added "Testing" column to align with QA requirements.

Added "Blocked" column to highlight stalled tasks.

Linked GitHub Issues to ensure traceability.

Assigned tasks using @mentions for collaboration.
