Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Addressing Conflicting Requirements

1. Real-Time Feedback vs. Performance Constraints

Users expect instant updates on fitness metrics, but processing large amounts of real-time data can slow the system.

Solution: Implemented WebSockets for real-time data streaming, while using caching techniques to reduce server load.

2. Simplicity vs. Advanced Features

Casual users need a simple interface, while athletes require advanced analytics.

Solution: Designed a customizable dashboard where users can toggle between basic and detailed views.

3. Security vs. User Experience

End-to-end encryption is necessary for HIPAA compliance but can slow down data retrieval.

Solution: Used AES-256 encryption while implementing indexed searches to optimize performance.

4. Scalability vs. Cost Constraints

The system must handle 1,000+ concurrent users, but cloud hosting can be expensive.

Solution: Adopted a serverless architecture with auto-scaling, ensuring efficient resource usage without unnecessary costs.

5. Free Access vs. Monetization

Business stakeholders want a paid model, but users expect free access.

Solution: Implemented a freemium model where basic tracking is free, and advanced analytics are part of a premium plan.

Final Thoughts

Balancing stakeholder needs required trade-offs and prioritization. Agile development allows us to iteratively improve features, ensuring the system remains efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
