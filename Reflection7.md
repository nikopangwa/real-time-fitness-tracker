Challenges in Template Selection & Customization

Choosing the right template: While Basic Kanban was simple, it lacked automation, and Team Planning was too complex for this project.

Setting up WIP limits: Initially, tasks piled up in "In Progress"; adding limits helped manage work.

Integrating with Sprint Planning: Mapping stories from Assignment 6 into Kanban was time-consuming.
