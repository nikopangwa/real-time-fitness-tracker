Balancing stakeholder needs with system constraints presented several challenges. One of the primary issues was ensuring real-time feedback while maintaining system performance. To address this, we optimized data processing with caching mechanisms. Another challenge was defining measurable test cases for abstract user needs like motivation. We overcame this by linking notifications and goal-tracking features to concrete metrics, such as step counts and calories burned.

Ensuring usability while keeping the UI clean was another consideration. Users wanted detailed analytics, but cluttered screens could affect usability. To resolve this, we implemented progressive disclosure, allowing users to expand details as needed. Overall, this assignment strengthened our ability to convert broad requirements into structured use cases and test scenarios.
