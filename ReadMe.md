# 🚀 Project Kanban Board  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository is using a **Kanban board** to manage tasks in an Agile workflow. Currently, no tasks have been linked to the board, but the structure and customization are set up for future iterations. 

---

## 🛠️ Kanban Board Setup  
We created a **custom Kanban board** in GitHub Projects with the following features:  
- **Custom Columns**: Added `Testing` and `Blocked` columns to align with QA and workflow requirements.  
- **Task Status**: Tasks will move through **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Testing**, and **Done** columns.  
- **Automation**: Once tasks are added, automation will handle task movements based on status updates.  

---

## 📌 Board Customization  
- **`Testing` column**: Added for tasks that need validation before completion.  
- **`Blocked` column**: Added to track tasks that are dependent on external factors or awaiting decisions.  
- **Other Columns**: Standard columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done** are included for task progression.

2️⃣ **Link to Board**: Issues will be linked to this project board for tracking progress.  
3️⃣ **Task Assignments**: Tasks will be assigned to team members using `@mentions`.

Although the Kanban board is currently empty, the **structure and workflow** are in place for a smooth Agile process. Tasks will be added shortly and tracked throughout the sprint.
