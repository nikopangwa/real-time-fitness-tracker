Challenges Faced in Prioritization and Estimation

Balancing Features for MVP – Determining which functionalities were essential for the first sprint required trade-offs between usability and technical complexity.

Effort Estimation – Estimating the complexity of tasks like encryption and real-time data tracking was difficult without extensive user testing.

Dependencies Management – Some features, like the fitness dashboard, depended on multiple other stories being completed first, which complicated backlog prioritization.

Stakeholder Alignment – Since I played all Scrum roles in this assignment, it was challenging to simulate real stakeholder resistance and conflicting priorities.

Strategies to Overcome These Challenges

Applied MoSCoW prioritization to focus on delivering the most critical features first.

Used story points to ensure effort estimation was relative to other tasks.

Identified dependencies early to avoid bottlenecks in development.

Considered user impact to ensure prioritization aligned with the end-user's needs.
